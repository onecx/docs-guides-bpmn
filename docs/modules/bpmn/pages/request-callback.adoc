= Request callback

Let's look at the typical pattern to integrate a communication with another system. 

bpmn-js::viewer[file=request-callback.bpmn,callouts="Activity_send_request"]

You might keep the process model independent of the fact if the notification service is synchronous or asynchronous and use a `service task` for sending a request. bpmn-js:callout[nr=1] 
When the send and receive functionality is modeled in separate tasks/events, a correlation ID needs to be generated manually, message buffering is necessary and it is essential to think about idempotency.
